# DesktopVoiceAssistant - Speakipy


We have made a desktop voice assistant. Basically started the software implementation by designing UML diagram, Listing out the Functional and Non-Functional requirements, and other related concepts.

For a front -end we've implemented GUI and Backend we've used sqlite DB & csv.
Some notable features are..
1. We've implemented GUI for login in to voice assistent
- Once a user logins the data will be stored in sqlite DB
2. We've added  commands such that user can handle any desktop applications easily through voice commands.
- And all the browsed history ( commands history) will be saved in another table of DB and CSV file.

3. If the new user wants to access our application, He can with some sign in credentials 
- These credentials will also be saved in our DB 

*4. additionally, We've implemented a touch mic, like we see in Google 
- such that whenever mic is clicked the user can say in the commands.
 
For over all implementation we've used Python Programming Language, and with some of its fascinating packages namely pyttsx3, gtts, PyGame, sqlite3 and many more...

*We have implemented a short game "Match Tiles" using PyGame module...

We've made a complete application look professional and easy to use.
